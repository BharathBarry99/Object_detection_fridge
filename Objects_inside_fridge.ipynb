This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to WongKinYiu and AlexeyAB for putting this repository together.\n","\n","\n","### **Accompanying Blog Post**\n","\n","We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [how to train YOLOv7](https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov7-custom-dataset-training-tutorial/), concurrently.\n","\n","### **Steps Covered in this Tutorial**\n","\n","To train our detector we take the following steps:\n","\n","* Install YOLOv7 dependencies\n","* Load custom dataset from Roboflow in YOLOv7 format\n","* Run YOLOv7 training\n","* Evaluate YOLOv7 performance\n","* Run YOLOv7 inference on test images\n","* OPTIONAL: Deployment\n","* OPTIONAL: Active Learning\n","\n","\n","### Preparing a Custom Dataset\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will utilize an open source computer vision dataset from one of the 90,000+ available on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com).\n","\n","If you already have your own images (and, optionally, annotations), you can convert your dataset using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), a set of tools developers use to build better computer vision models quickly and accurately. 100k+ developers use roboflow for (automatic) annotation, converting dataset formats (like to YOLOv7), training, deploying, and improving their datasets/models.\n","\n","Follow [the getting started guide here](https://docs.roboflow.com/quick-start) to create and prepare your own custom dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":328},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2467674,"status":"error","timestamp":1676478144710,"user":{"displayName":"WP
